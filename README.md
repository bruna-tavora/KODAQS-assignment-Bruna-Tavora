# KODAQS-assignment-Bruna-Tavora
This repository was created for the Kodaqs course as part of the KDQ_CP2_4_Module_4.1 assignment on data quality. It includes code for data analysis in Python that I developed with the assistance of DeepSeek AI. After conducting some tests comparing the free version of ChatGPT and DeepSeek, I achieved better results when running code produced by DeepSeek. I  prompted the generative AI with instructions such as: “Generate Python code to perform topic modeling"; "Use the most common libraries and transformers such as pandas and BERTopic.”

I then used this code to do both: obtain an overview of my dataset and exercize some coding strategies. My dataser consists of Digital Behavioral Data extracted with a social listening tool name FanPage Karma. Data consists of 10 years of digital communicational from the Parliamentary Agriculture Front’s Meta platforms (including Instagram, Facebook, and the Meta Ads Library). This is a political coalition in Brazil embededd in neo-extractivist public policies and practices.
