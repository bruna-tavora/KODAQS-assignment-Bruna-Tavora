This repository was created for the Kodaqs course as part of the KDQ_CP2_4_Module_4.1 assignment on data quality. It includes Python code for data analysis that I developed with the assistance of DeepSeek AI.

After conducting tests comparing the free version of ChatGPT and DeepSeek, I achieved better results when running the code generated by DeepSeek. I prompted the generative AI with the following prompt: "Generate code that allows me to perform network analysis using keywords as the unit of analysis, with Python as the main programming language and Google Colab as the development environment."

I then used this code both to obtain an overview of my dataset and to practice different coding strategies. My dataset consists of digital behavioral data extracted using the web application YouTube Data Tools, which was employed to collect all videos published on a political coalition’s YouTube channel (The Parliamentary Agriculture Front, n = 336). The downloaded CSV file includes a column containing keywords assigned by the channel’s users, named after "tags". YTDT is part of the Digital Methods Initiative, UvA.

###Limitations: this is an exploratory exercize for reproducibility and it is limited in terms of advanced network metrics such as modularity, centrality measures, or community detection, which can be incorporated by cooperating with other CSS researchers. Coding is commented in Portuguese. I tried different strategies for automatic translating, but didn't work!

Key files include: 
dataset_youtube_FPA.csv: YouTube data extracted from the coalition’s channel 
Network_analysis_tags.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the network analysis code 
Graphs for keyword co-occurrence
