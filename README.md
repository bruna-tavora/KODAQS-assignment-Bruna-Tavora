This repository was created for the Kodaqs course as part of the KDQ_CP2_4_Module_4.1 assignment on data quality. It includes Python code for data analysis that I developed with the assistance of DeepSeek AI.

After conducting tests comparing the free version of ChatGPT and DeepSeek, I achieved better results when running the code generated by DeepSeek. I prompted the generative AI with instructions such as: “Generate Python code to perform topic modeling” and “Use common libraries and transformers such as pandas and BERTopic.” I used Colab to run the Python code. 

I then used this code both to obtain an overview of my dataset and to practice different coding strategies. My dataset consists of digital behavioral data extracted using a social listening tool called Fanpage Karma. The data covers 10 years (2015-2025) of digital communication from the Parliamentary Agriculture Front’s Meta platforms (including Instagram, Facebook, and the Meta Ads Library). This is a political coalition in Brazil embedded in neo-extractivist public policies and practices.
