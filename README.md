# KODAQS-assignment-Bruna-Tavora
This repository was created for the Kodaqs course as part of the KDQ_CP2_4_Module_4.1 assignment on data quality. It includes a protocol to analyze a sample dataset on the Parliamentary Agriculture Front’s social media, focusing on how it addresses hunger and food insecurity. The material also informed a book chapter on hunger and disinformation.
